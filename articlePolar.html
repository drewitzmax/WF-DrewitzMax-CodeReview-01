            <div class="articleSection">Polar announced two new workout trackers today: the more expensive Vantage V and
                the cheaper Vantage M companion. Let’s start with the bigger, more expensive watch. The Vantage V costs
                $499.90 and includes a new optical heart rate sensor with nine LEDs along two different wavelengths
                (green and red). This, the company says, should make its heart rate readings more accurate.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">The biggest addition to the watch is its power measurements for running. This is
                a relatively new metric, but you might recognize it because of products like Stryd. It essentially
                measures a wearer’s work output, similar to how cyclists measure their watts generated. Runners likely
                will appreciate this for training purposes. It doesn’t support LTE, although it does have a built-in
                GPS. It charges over a custom charger and should last for 40 hours of sports activity time, Polar says.
                It’s also water and swim-proof. The watch features a 1.2-inch, 240 x 240 touchscreen that’ll turn off
                once wearers enter their workout mode. It’s available in white, black, and orange.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">The cheaper Vantage M costs $279.90 and features a lot of the same technology,
                except for the touchscreen and running power detection. Unlike on the Vantage V, you can actually change
                the bands on the Vantage M. The watch also doesn’t include one of Polar’s signature software features,
                “recovery mode,” which analyzes wearers’ previous workouts to determine how long they’ll need to
                recover. Both watches are available for preorder today through Polar’s website and will ship in October.
