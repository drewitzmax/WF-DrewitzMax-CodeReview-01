            <div class="articleSection">Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure
                leak occurred on the
                International Space Station, and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state
                space corporation, Roscosmos, are now trying to quell the rumors.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space
                agency is working
                closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. The statement also notes that no information
                will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, despite rampant speculation in the Russian
                press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">During a teleconference yesterday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and
                Roscosmos general director
                Dmitry Rogozin “affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical
                teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations
                and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation,” according to the statement. “They
                acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft
                to ensure mission success.”</div>
            <div class="articleSection">NASA and Roscosmos first detected a drop in the space station’s pressure around
                7PM ET on Wednesday,
                August 29th, suspecting that there was a leak of some kind on the ISS. The air was escaping at such a
                slow rate, though, that flight controllers opted not to wake the crew. The next day, the six astronauts
                on board the ISS traced the leak to a small hole inside one of the two Russian Soyuz capsules docked to
                the space station — the vehicles used to bring crew to and from Earth. This particular Soyuz has been at
                the ISS since June 8th, and the hole was found in one of the modules that is jettisoned before the Soyuz
                enters Earth’s atmosphere during its descent. So the piece is not necessary for the entire trip back to
                the ground.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">The hole was successfully patched up on Thursday, August 30th, but the mystery
                over the origin of the
                hole has remained. The ideas of in-space sabotage were first suggested by Roscosmos, which formed a
                state commission to get to the bottom of the leak. After dismissing the theory of a micrometeoroid
                impact, Rogozin said it looked as if the hole had been made by a drill. (NASA allegedly published and
                then removed pictures of the hole, which did look as if it had been made by a drill of some kind.)
                Rogozin noted that Roscosmos would “find out whether it was an accidental defect or a deliberate
                spoilage and where it was done — either on Earth or in space,” according to a report in TASS.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">Russia has a noted history of blaming spacecraft failures on possible sabotage,
                so this kind of
                behavior isn’t new. However, the gossip over the leak seems to have only grown in the last couple of
                weeks. As first reported by Ars Technica, a story published in Russia’s Kommersant cited anonymous
                sources from Roscosmos, who claimed that investigators were looking into the possibility that the hole
                was caused by a NASA astronaut. The theory was that one of the three American crew members had gotten
                sick, so one of the astronauts caused the leak in order to force a quick evacuation to Earth.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">In fact, the rumors have gotten so bad that ISS commander Drew Feustel actually
                had to flat-out deny
                that anyone on board the station was involved in some way. “I can unequivocally say that the crew had
                nothing to do with this on orbit, without a doubt, and I think it’s actually a shame and somewhat
                embarrassing that anybody is wasting any time talking about something that the crew was involved in,”
                Feustel said in an interview from space with ABC News, as reported by CBS.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">Despite having first floated the theory of sabotage, Rogozin has taken to
                criticizing journalists for
                speculating about the cause of the leak. “The recent gossip and rumors circulating about the incident at
                the ISS hinder the work of Roscosmos experts and are designed to subvert the friendly relations among
                the crew members of the space station,” Rogozin said on Facebook, according to a TASS report. “All
                statements citing unnamed sources are inadmissible until Roscosmos special commission concludes its
                work,” he added.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">Meanwhile, there is another, more plausible theory, that is still on the table:
                that the hole was made
                by a worker on the ground, who then hastily patched it up before the Soyuz launched on June 6th. Then
                somehow the patch was removed, exposing the hole. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said that
                faulty work on Earth has not been ruled out, TASS reports.</div>
            <div class="articleSection">In a previous statement on September 5th, Roscosmos said that it plans to finish
                its investigation
                this month. “All conclusions and decisions will be announced after the commission’s work is completed,”
                according to the corporation.</div>
